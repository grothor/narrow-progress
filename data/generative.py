**_Generative models of CIFAR-10 Natural Images _****[Year: bits-per-subpixel, method]. Compiled by Durk Kingma.**

**Why we care:**
(1) The compression=prediction=understanding=intelligence view (see Hutter prize, etc.). (Note that perplexity, log-likelihood, and #bits are all equivalent measurements.)
(2) Learning a generative model is a prominent auxiliary task towards semi-supervised learning. Current SOTA semi-supervised classification results utilize generative models.
3) You're finding patterns in the data that let you compress it more efficiently. Ultimate pattern recognition benchmark because you're trying to find the patterns in all the data.
